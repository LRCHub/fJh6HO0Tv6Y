[00:24.80] It's one o'clock and time for lunch,
[00:29.44] When the sun beats down and I lie on the bench
[00:32.13] I can always hear them talk
[00:45.63] 
[00:36.08] There's always been Ethel:
[00:38.59] "Jacob, wake up! You've got to tidy your room now."
[00:44.31] And then Mister Lewis:
[00:47.12] "Isn't it time that he was out on his own?"
[00:52.82] Over the garden wall, two little lovebirds - cuckoo to you!
[00:58.42] Keep them mowing blades sharp...
[01:14.42] 
[01:00.11] I know what I like, and I like what I know;
[01:11.30] Getting better in your wardrobe, stepping one beyond your show
[01:42.30] 
[01:40.46] Sunday night, Mr Farmer called, said:
[01:43.07] "Listen son, you're wasting your time; there's a future for you
[01:46.85] In the fire escape trade. Come up to town!"
[01:50.91] But I remebered a voice from the past;
[01:54.17] "Gambling only pays when you're winning"
[01:56.82] - I had to thank old Miss Mort for schooling a failure
[02:00.22] Keep them mowing blades sharp...
[02:16.22] 
[02:01.95] I know what I like, and I like what I know;
[02:13.04] Getting better in your wardrobe, stepping one beyond your show
[02:44.04] 
[02:56.61] When the sun beats down and I lie on the bench,
[02:59.36] I can always hear them talk.
[03:02.19] Me, I'm just a lawnmower - you can tell me by the way I walk

She looked me over and I guess she thought I was all right
Well, all right in a sort of a limited way for an off-night
She said, "Don't I know you from the cinematographer's party?"
And I said, "Who am I to blow against the wind?"

I know what I know
I'll sing what I said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep in the back of my head
I know what I know
I'll sing what I said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep in the back of my head, yea-yeah, yea-yeah

She said, "Somethin' about you really reminds me of money"
Well, she is the kind of a girl who could say things that..., weren't that funny?
I said, "What does that mean I really remind you of money?"
She said, "Who am I to blow against the wind?"

I know what I know
I'll sing what I said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep in the back of my head
I know what I know
I'll sing what I said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep in the back of my head

In the back of my head
In the back of my head
It's in the back of my head
In the back of my head
In the back of my head
It's in the back of my head
In the back of my head

She moved so easily, all I could think of was sunlight
I said, "Aren't you the woman who was recently given a fullbright?"
She said, "Don't I know you from the cinematographer's party?"
And I said, "Who am I to blow against the wind?"

I know what I know
I'll sing what I said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep in the back of my head
I know what I know
I'll sing what I said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep in the back of my head

In the back of my head
In the back of my head
It's in the back of my head
In the back of my head
In the back of my head
It's in the back of my head
In the back of my head

(I know what I know)
I know what I know
(We come and we go)
Yeah, we come and we go

(I know what I know)
I know what I know
(We come and we go)
Yes, we come and we go

But I know, but I know
But I know, I know, but I know
I know, I know
I know, I know

It's in the back of my head
In the back of my head
In the back of my head
It's in the back of my head
In the back of my head
In the back of my head
It's in the back of my head
In the back of my head
In the back of my head

And I know (the back of my head, the back of my head, the back of my head)
I know what I know

[Hook:]
I know what you want, I know what you want,
I know what you want, I know what you want,
I know what you want, I know what you want,
I know what you want.
You want everything, so let's do everything

[Verse 1:]
I'm in a two-door, I'm in a new lane,
I gotta know my name, I need a new name.
I know what you want.

[Hook:]
I know what you want, I know what you want,
I know what you want,
You want everything, so let's do everything.

[Verse 2:]
They moving too slow, we are a new play
So high I lift funny, your love is not safe.

[Hook:]
I know what you want, I know what you want,
I know what you want,
You want everything, so let's do everything.

Man down, where you're from, nigga,
Fuck who you know, where you're from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay home my nigga
Best rockabye I've grown my nigga.
